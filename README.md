# Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer

This thesis project focuses on solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and visualizing the underlying optimization algorithms through a web-based application. It is designed to serve as an educational tool for understanding and applying optimization techniques.

## Thesis Overview

The project provides:
- A **sequential visualization** of the **Hill Climbing algorithm**.
- Techniques to **escape local optima**, including:
  - **Random restarts**
  - **Larger search radii**

The key contribution lies in offering an interactive, intuitive way to understand the behavior of optimization algorithms used for solving TSP.

## Features

- Simulates the **Traveling Salesman Problem** and displays step-by-step visualizations.
- Supports:
  - Forward, backward, and repeat navigation of the algorithm's steps.
  - Custom problem maps or generation of random cities.
  - Algorithm parameter tuning (e.g., number of iterations for hill climbing with restarts).
- Comparative performance evaluation of different algorithms.
- Clear, detailed representation of algorithm progress and decision-making.

## Algorithms

Implemented algorithms:
- Basic **Hill Climbing**
- **Hill Climbing with Random Restarts**
- **Hill Climbing with Larger Search Radii**

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
